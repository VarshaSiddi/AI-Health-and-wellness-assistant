🩺 AI Health & Wellness Assistant 🤖Add commentMore actions
As a part of AI Azure internship from Microsoft, I built this personalized Ai health assitant.
This is a simple AI-based assistant that takes your basic health vitals — like heart rate, blood pressure, sugar level, oxygen level, and temperature(which are now easy to get from our smartwatches and digital health devices revolutionizing health sector)— and gives you advice on how you’re doing and what to do next.
It’s designed to feel like a friend who knows a bit about health and wants you to stay well. 😊

Features include:
- 👤 Personalized interaction using name and age  
- 🧾 Input: Heart Rate, BP, SpO2, Sugar, Temperature  
- 🩺 Interprets each vital with a health status summary  
- 🍱 Suggests diet, hydration, and sleep improvements  
- 📌 Final health score + actionable checklist  
- 😄 Emoji-based feedback for friendly UX  
- 💡 Entirely offline & beginner-friendly  

Technology Used:
Python 🐍
Basic rule-based logic (no machine learning)
Just simple if-else conditions that feel like advice from a human

If you just want to exlpore, open the health_assistant.py file and enter the data required if you are aware and then you can just get your health status, as simple as it is!!

Future scope:
I want to extend it with GUI, maintaing user database improving interaction, voice based modules, and also integrating translators(multi-lingual recognition).

🤝Open to suggestions and feedback
